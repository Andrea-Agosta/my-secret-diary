# Secret Diary project

Exercise for [The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/) on Udemy for section Database. This website has a login and registration form connected to the database and in the diary section, all the updates are automatically saved in the database.

### Tecnology used

In this project for the frontend side I used Bootstrap 5.0, to make the registration form and the backend side I used php 7. I used mySQL Database for the data storage. After the registration the user is redirect to a website where they can write something in a textarea. All the updates are captured by a jQuery listener and with ajax the system send the data to mySQL. This website used the cookies to save the session information. Once the user clicks on the logout button the cookie is removed.
